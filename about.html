    <h2>About Me</h2>
 <p>
        My name is Ahmed Hany, and I am a dedicated Front-End Developer with a strong passion 
        for crafting clean, responsive, and visually appealing websites. I specialize in HTML, CSS, 
        and JavaScript, and I always aim to create designs that are not only beautiful but also functional 
        and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that good design is all about the perfect balance between aesthetics and usability. 
        That’s why I pay attention to every detail, from the layout and colors to the smooth animations 
        that enhance the user experience.
